In freshman year, I accidentally came up with a math problem so hard it would remove the next two years of my free time: What are the equilibrium distributions of *n* mutually repulsive points confined to a sphere? 

Now, I could go and explain this incredibly confusing system here, or I could just direct to the existing [GitHub page](https://github.com/smostek/n-points-on-a-sphere) instead.

The project has currently stagnated a bit as other projects have taken my attention, but as it currently stands the question is one more at the intersection of analytic geometry and group theory: for a given spherical symmetry group and number of vertices, how many distinct polyhedra can be constructed?
