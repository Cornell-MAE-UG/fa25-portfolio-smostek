Most engineers take Dynamics and say "that sucked don't make me think about a vector ever again." I said "next semester I'm going to take Intermediate Dynamics," and then the following semester I took Advanced Dynamics and Vibrations. 

I probably should have been a physics major.

On GitHub I've made a [repository](https://github.com/smostek/Dynamics) for the many scripts I've used to answer the questions that have plauged man for generations like "what if you had a pendulum whose string was attached to a spool so the string keeps getting longer?" In all seriousness, there's some really interesting phyics in there, like my final project for MAE 4730 Intermediate Dynamics where I analyzed a system in which a ball rolled inside of a hemispherical bowl that itself could also roll. Slightly more practical would be the reaction wheel satellite control system I modelled for MAE 3260 System Dynamics.

Finally, this is as good a place as any to attach my [final report]({{ "/assets/46000_FinalReport" | relative_url }}) for 46000 Advanced Dynamics and Vibrations (taken abroad at DTU), which analysed the deceptively elaborate vibration response of a clamped thin beam with a point mass in the middle.
