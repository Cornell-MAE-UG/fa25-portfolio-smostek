The final project of my fourth semester fluid dynamics class was a hands-on group project in which we were given a random device with the directive of dissassembling it to explain any fluid-mechanical components. My group, which in practice devolved into just me with some hangers-on, was given a weed-wacker and we (read "I") analyzed its carburetor. The submission, a 5-minute video detailing our analysis, can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg-YISTY40I).
