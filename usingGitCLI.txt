This is a document to remind me how to edit this website

To preview the website by running it locally run `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the parent folder

To push to gitHub run 
```git add .
git commit -m "<Commit Edit>"
git push origin main
```

I don't think you need to worry about the PAT anymore, but you can always revive the one you made the first time
